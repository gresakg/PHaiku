<h2>Features</h2>
<h3>Multilanguage</h3>
<p>
	Phaiku provides multilanguage features by default. To use them, edit
	the config file and store each language data in it's own folder.
</p>
<h3>Themable</h3>
<p>
	Phaiku uses simple php templates for rendering. There's no new templating 
	language to learn, just echo your variables and you're done.
</p>
<p>
	You can have as many themes as you want in your templates folder and change
	them to your needs. A simple Skela template is just the default you can use 
	or replace.
</p>
<h3>Widget support</h3>
<p>
	Phaiku provides an easy to use widgets interface. The main and the language
	menus are implemented as widgets and a simple Haiku widget, that displays
	random haikus in the sidebar may all serve as examples.
</p>
<h3>Extendable</h3>
<p>
	You may add your own routes (to the config.php file) and define controllers
	that controll them. The /contact route serves as an example.
