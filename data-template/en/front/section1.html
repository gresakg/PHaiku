		<strong>Phaiku</strong> is a fast and simple but <em>extensible</em> static website manager
		created with a micro framework <a href="http://www.slimframework.com/">Slim</a>.
		It works without databases and there's no administration section. 
		You can update the site using ftp, sftp or preferably <a href="http://git-scm.com/">git</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
		PHaiku is at this stage a proof of concept, meant to be played with,
		explored and extended. It has a very brief source code, that's ought to
		be understandable.
	</p>
	<p>
		The name <em>PHaiku</em> is obviously derived from PHP and haiku, the later
		being a short poetry form of Japanese origin, consisting of only five verses
		with respectively 5 - 7 - 5 syllabes. Read more about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haiku">haiku on Wikipedia</a>.
