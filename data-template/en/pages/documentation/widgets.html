	<h2>Widgets</h2>
	<p>You can create widgets in Phaiku in a quite simple way. You don't have to be
	a very advanced php programmer for this.</p>
	<p>Widgets are created in the class that extends Phaiku (see the PHaiku folder).
	While you can directly edit the Haiku.php file, a better idea would be to copy
	the Haiku.php to something like MyHaiku.php, rename the clas MyHaiku:</p>
	<pre class='prettyprint linenums'>
namespace PHaiku;

class MyHaiku extends PHaiku {
...
	</pre>
	<p>and accordingly change the <code>class.name</code> attribute in <code>./config/config.php</code></p>
	<pre class='prettyprint linenums'>
"class.name" => "\PHaiku\MyHaiku",
	</pre>
	<p>
		Now you can safely make all the changes you want.
	</p>
	<h3>Create a method</h3>
	<p>Create a new method in your MyHaiku class:</p>
	<pre class='prettyprint linenums'>
public function awesomeWidget() {
	// do whatever you need to populate $html with content (like fetching an rss file)
	return $html;
}
	</pre>
	<p>
		You can of course add any additional methods that will help your widgets
		functionality.
	</p>
	<h3>Widget views</h3>
	<p>
		Sometimes you will want a view file to help you render your data. Your code
		will be cleaner. Put the view file in your theme folder and call it like this:
	</p>
	<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
$html = $this->app->view->fetch("awesomewidgetview.php");
return $html;	
	</pre>
	<p>
		If you have more widget you may want to put all widget views in a separate
		folder in your theme <code>widgets/awesomewidget.php</code>
	</p>
	<h3>Widget data</h3>
	<p>Some widgets, like the haiku widget provided in the sample, may need data.
	You can put widget data as array in a php file the <code>./data</code> folder.
	Name the file by the widget and underscore it (to prevent the future menu builder from 
	including it in the menu) <code>_awesome.php</code>. Sample data for random Linus Torvalds quotes:</p>
	<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
&lt;?php
return [
	"Software is like sex: it's better when it's free.",
	"Microsoft isn't evil, they just make really crappy operating systems.",
	"Intelligence is the ability to avoid doing work, yet getting the work done.",
	"Any program is only as good as it is useful."
];
	</pre>
	<p>I think, that's all you need to know about widgets.</p>
	<p><strong>Be creative!</strong></p>
