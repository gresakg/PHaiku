	<h2>Basic usage</h2>
	<p>
		All the data is located in the <code>./data</code> folder unless specified 
		differently in the <code>./config/config.php</code> under the <code>data.source</code>	
		keyword.
	</p>
	<h3>Toggle multilingual</h3>
	<p>
		By default as a demo, two languages will be present: english (en) and slovenian (sl).
		If you don't need multilingual features just do the following:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>in the <code>./config/config.php</code> file set the key "multilingual" to false: <code>"multilingual" => false,</code>		</li>
		<li>delete the language folders in the <code>./data</code> folder.
	</ul>
	<p>
		The file structure of the ./data folder if multilingual is enabled:
	</p>
	<pre>
./data
	/en/
		_config.php
		_menu.php
		_some_widget_data.php
		index.html
		some_content.html
		...
	/fr/
		_config.php
		_some_widget_data_in_french.php
		_menu.php
		index.php
		content_in_french.html
		...
	</pre>
	<p>
		The file structure of the ./data folder if multilingual is not enabled:
	</p>
	<pre>
./data
	_config.php
	_menu.php
	_some_widget_data.php
	index.html
	some_content.html
	...
	</pre>
	<h3>Add content</h3>
	<p>
		To add a new content page, you must create that page in html and save it as 
		an html file. Example: <code>foo.html</code> The page will be visible as soon
		as it is saved under the url <code>/p/foo</code> (in case of multilanguage, this 
		will be prefixed with the two letter language code).
	</p>
	<p>
		The page will not (at this time) be visible in the menu. To make it accessible from 
		the menu add <code>"Foo" => "/p/foo",</code> to the menu.
	</p>
	<p>
		If you have multilingual enabled, the language prefix will be added automatically.
		You just have to have a separate menu for each language in their respecitve
		language folders (see file structure above).
	</p>
	<h3>Categories</h3>
	<p>
		You can categorise your content by storing it to subfolders inside the ./data 
		folder. <code>./data/{language}/foo/bar.html</code> will be accessible under <code>{language}/p/foo/bar</code>.
	</p>
	<p>
		This is how you reflect this in the menu:
	</p>
	<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
"Foo" => [
	"Bar" => "/p/foo/bar",
]	
	</pre>
	<p>
		If you're using the provided Dropdowns for extension, you'll have a nice 
		dropdown, just as this one in the demo. Else, you may use any other menu 
		sistem in the frontend.
	</p>
	<p>
		Although this will scale to infinity, a good practice is to have up to three
		categories deep. Few users will have the will to navigate further ...
	</p>
	<h3>Deleting</h3>
	<p>
		Although deleting is as easy as deleting files, and lines in the menu, you might
		also consider renaming the files: <code>foo.html.bak</code> will no longer 
		be accessible from the frontend, or commenting the lines of the menu you no longer need.
	</p>
	<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
&lt?php
return [	
	"Home" => "/" ,
	"Foo" => "/p/foo",
	"Bar" => [
		// "Baz" => "/p/bar/baz", <em> <<< this entry will disapear from the menu</em>
		"Booz" => "/p/bar/booz",
	]
];
	</pre>
	<p>
		That's all there is for the basics.
	</p>
