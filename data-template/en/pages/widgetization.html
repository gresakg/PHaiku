<div>
	<p>Now that I think about it: any page is essentially build out of widgets. Look
	at it this way: main content is just content widget.</p>
	<p>So what a controller does is just call the appropriate widgets and a template
	that represents them.</p>
	<p>For Phaiku this means just that controller functions will not directly get 
	the pages content, but rely on content (or page content) widget.</p>
