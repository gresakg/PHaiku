<h2>Templates</h2>
<p>
	To desambiguate I will call <strong>theme</strong> a template as a whole directory of files and
	<strong>template</strong> a separate php file that is used to render content.
</p>
<p>
	The themes are located in the <code>./templates</code> directory. The default 
	theme is Skela and it's based on the <a href="https://github.com/gresakg/Skela">Skela</a> 
	1080px grid system.
</p>
<p>
	You can use and modify Skela which tends to be as agnostic as possible, so that 
	it's easy to modify it with your own styles.
</p>
<p>
	However, it's also easy to implement any of the html templates you can	grab 
	on the web, or create your own.
</p>
<h3>Basic concepts</h3>
<p>
	Templates are php files. For basic usage you need at least index.php. This file
	can include other files (like header.php, footer.php and aside.php ...). To include
	dynamic content, you simply echo variables that are defined in the code or include
	other files. 
</p>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
&lt;?php  include("header.php"); ?&gt;
&lt;div class="row"&gt;
	&lt;div class="content fourteen columns"&gt;
		&lt;?php echo $content;  ?&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;aside class="four columns"&gt;
		&lt;?php include 'aside.php';?&gt;
	&lt;/aside&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;?php include("footer.php"); ?&gt;
</pre>
<h3>Variables</h3>
<p>Here's a list of variables you can use in templates, that are predefined by Phaiku:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>$language</strong> - contains the two letter language code of the 
		current language. You need this mainly to set the language in the header section.
		It's defined by the <code>PHaiku::setBasicData()</code> method.
	</li>
	<li><strong>$title</strong> - contains whatever you set in the <code>_config.php</code>
		file, used for setting the content of the <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> tag. You can
	use it also to set the main heading of the site or anywhere else.</li>
	<li><strong>$baseurl</strong> - contains the base url which is the root url of
	your PHaiku installation.</li>
	<li><strong>$template_url</strong> - contains the url of the current template.
		It's extremely usefull for setting the correct urls for css, javascript and image
		inclusions. Example:
		<pre class='prettyprint lang-php'>&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="&lt;?php echo $template_url; ?&gt;/css/custom.css"&gt;</pre>
		It's defined by the <code>PHaiku::setBasicData()</code> method.
	</li>
	<li><strong>$content</strong> - holds the main content of the current page (whatever 
		content you create in your .html files). It's defined by the <code>PHaiku::setPage()</code> 
		method.
	</li>
	<li><strong>$widgets</strong> - this variable contains an object of type <code>stdClass</code>
		containing all the widgets by the names you give them. Predefined widgets are <code>$widgets->menu</code>
		containing the main menu, and <code>$widgets->langmenu</code> for multilingual sites
		containing the language menu. Example usage:
		<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
&lt;header&gt;
	&lt;div class="row"&gt;
		&lt;div class="nine columns"&gt;&lt;h1&gt;&lt;?php echo $title; ?&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
		&lt;div class="nine columns"&gt;&lt;?php echo $widgets->langmenu; ?&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;?php echo $widgets->menu; ?&gt;
&lt;/header&gt;
		</pre>
	</li>
</ul>
<h3>Define custom variables</h3>
<p>You can define as many custom variables as you want in the <code>_config.php</code> file(s).
This is usefull to define things like footers, site slogans and in the case of multilingual
sites, it's the place to define common language strings, since there's a _config.php 
file present in every language folder for the language in question. Example _config.php file
contents:
</p>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
return [
	"title" => "PHaiku",
	"slogan" => "brief and efficient",
	"copyright" => "(c) 2014 gresak.net",
	"more" => "More to comme ..."
];
</pre>
<p>That's all there is to templates.</p>
