			<strong>Phaiku</strong> is a fast and simple but <em>extensible</em> static website manager
			created with a micro framework <a href="http://www.slimframework.com/">Slim</a>.
			It works without databases and there's no administration section. 
			You can update the site using ftp, sftp or preferably <a href="http://git-scm.com/">git</a>.
		</p>
		<p>
			PHaiku is at this stage a proof of concept, meant to be played with,
			explored and extended. It has a very brief source code, that's ought to
			be understandable.
		</p>
		<p>
			The name <em>PHaiku</em> is obviously derived from PHP and haiku, the later
			being a short poetry form of Japanese origin, consisting of only five verses
			with respectively 5 - 7 - 5 syllabes. Read more about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haiku">haiku on Wikipedia</a>.

		<h2>Features</h2>
		<h3>Multilanguage</h3>
		<p>
			Phaiku provides multilanguage features by default. To use them, edit
			the config file and store each language data in it's own folder.
		</p>
		<h3>Themable</h3>
		<p>
			Phaiku uses simple php templates for rendering. There's no new templating 
			language to learn, just echo your variables and you're done.
		</p>
		<p>
			You can have as many themes as you want in your templates folder and change
			them to your needs. A simple Skela template is just the default you can use 
			or replace.
		</p>
		<h3>Widget support</h3>
		<p>
			Phaiku provides an easy to use widgets interface. The main and the language
			menus are implemented as widgets and a simple Haiku widget, that displays
			random haikus in the sidebar may all serve as examples.
		</p>
		<h3>Extendable</h3>
		<p>
			You may add your own routes (to the config.php file) and define controllers
			that controll them. The /contact route serves as example, though is not (yet) 
			fully implemented.
